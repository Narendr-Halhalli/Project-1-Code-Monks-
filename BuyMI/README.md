## 💻 How to Run the Project in VS Code

### ✅ Prerequisites

### 📥 Steps to Run the Project

#### 1. Create a Project Folder
- Create a new folder on your system, e.g., `BuyMI-Home`.

#### 2. Add the Required Files
- Inside that folder, create the following files:
  - `index.html` → Paste the provided home page HTML
  - `style.css` → Write your CSS styles here
  - `script.js` → Add your JavaScript for AI orb/chat
  - (Optional) Create `wishlist.html`, `cart.html`, `shopping.html`, `stylegenie.html` for navigation to work

#### 3. Open the Folder in VS Code
- Open **Visual Studio Code**
- Go to `File > Open Folder...` and select the `BuyMI-Home` folder

#### 4. Run the HTML File

- Install the **Live Server** extension in VS Code:
  - Go to Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X`)
  - Search for `Live Server` and install it
- Right-click `index.html` and select **“Open with Live Server”**

> This will open the home page in your default browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html`

##### 🔵 Method 2: Manual Open
